### Welcome to Roller Derby Finder!

This site helps to connect skaters, officials, and non-skating officials with games.

You can find the site at https://rollerderbyfinder.herokuapp.com/

To get started using the app, log in with any Google account and fill out your user profile. From there, you can search for existing games and add yourself as a player, an official, or an NSO, or you can create a game of your own.

This app was created with npx create-react-app. It uses MySQL, Sequelize, Express, and Node on the back end, and React with SCSS on the front end.

One new feature that I learned to create this application was user-initiated image uploading, to allow users to have profile pictures. This was implemented using the Cloudinary service.
